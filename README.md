# Taylor Series Program (Python)

## 📌 Description
This project is a Python program that uses **Taylor’s Series** to approximate the value of a mathematical function. Instead of relying on built-in math functions, the program applies the Taylor series formula step by step to compute the result, making the logic and mathematics behind the approximation clear.

## 🧮 What is Taylor’s Series?
Taylor’s Series is a mathematical technique used to represent a function as an infinite sum of terms derived from its derivatives at a specific point. In practice, a finite number of terms is used to approximate functions such as:
- sin(x)
- cos(x)
- eˣ

This program demonstrates how those approximations are calculated using Python.
